# Portfolio site

This is a minimal static portfolio template.

How to use
1. Replace the placeholder fields in index.html (Your Name, title, bio).
2. Replace profile image at assets/img/profile-placeholder.png or update index.html to use your image URL.
3. Edit projects.json to list your projects.
4. Customize colors in assets/css/style.css (change --accent).
5. Commit and push to GitHub. In repo Settings -> Pages, set source to main branch / root (or use gh-pages branch).
6. Wait a minute and your site will be available at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/.

Notes
- I found a resume already in your repo: `Resume - Harvey Kim Solano.pdf`. The template links that file from the header and hero resume button.
- If you want, I can create these files and push them to your repo for you — tell me whether you want me to commit them and provide the branch name to push to.
